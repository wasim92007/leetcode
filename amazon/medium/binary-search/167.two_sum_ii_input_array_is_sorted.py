#
# Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in
# non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific
# target number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2]
# where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.
# 
# Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, added by one as an
# integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.
# 
# The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not
# use the same element twice.
# 
# Your solution must use only constant extra space.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
# Output: [1,2]
# Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We
# return [1, 2].
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
# Output: [1,3]
# Explanation: The sum of 2 and 4 is 6. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 3. We
# return [1, 3].
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1
# Output: [1,2]
# Explanation: The sum of -1 and 0 is -1. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We
# return [1, 2].
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 2 <= numbers.length <= 3 * 10^4
# -1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000
# numbers is sorted in non-decreasing order.
# -1000 <= target <= 1000
# The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution.

class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:

        ## Algorithm: Here as the array is sorted we can use two pointer approach
        l, r = 0, len(numbers) - 1
        ## We will use l < r, as l = r will consider overlap
        while l < r:
            sum = numbers[l] + numbers[r]
            ## If target isfound return
            if sum == target:
                return [l+1, r+1]
            ## If target is greater than sum increment the left pointer
            elif target > sum:
                l += 1
            else:
                r -= 1
